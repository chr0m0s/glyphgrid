# glyphgrid

Watch my algorithm as he arranges letters on a canvas. Based on your input, a responsive grid is created. Your words are set in the font Cousine-Regular by Steve Matteson. Font size and grid depend on the number of letters entered. Each single letter is resolved into an object with a variety of moving points. These individual dots are moved in each frame of the animation and draw delicate patterns on the canvas.
